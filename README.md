# Logical AI for Constructing Logical Chains

## About the Project

This project is an implementation of a logical artificial intelligence (AI) for constructing logical chains and making conclusions based on the provided data. The AI analyzes logical relationships between events and makes assumptions about possible conclusions.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP archive and unpack it.
3. In the terminal, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd TensorFlow-Logic-AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run main.py to interact with the model.
```
python fit_model.py
```
## Sample Data

The logic.txt file contains examples of input data and expected outputs for training the model. Here are some examples:

```
На улице мокрая лужа | Вероятнее всего был дождь.
Моё окно в дом разбито! | Возможно, вас ограбили
...
```
## Improving the Model

You can experiment with different neural network architectures, training parameters, and data preprocessing to enhance the accuracy and confidence of the model.
